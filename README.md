# CS564Project
Project for CS564 - Database Management Systems

**Template for Checkpoint 1 write-up**

**Title of the project:** <Please enter title here>

**Group members:**<please list the names and emails of all members>

**Motivation and project description**
Write 2-3 paragraphs describing specifically what you want to do for your final project. You should at least cover (i) the application domain (ii) the type of applications (web-based, standalone, or app), (iii) why it is essential to have a database in this domain application; and (iv) a description of the functionality of the application.

For the functionalities of the application, at the minimum, you must handle inserting, deleting, and modifying data in the database, as well as queries that involve getting inputs from users and retrieving information from multiple sources.

**Datasets**
Write 1-2 paragraphs describing your dataset, where you get it (URL), the reasons why you choose this dataset, attributes of the selected dataset, why this dataset addresses at least the minimum requirement of the project.

**ER Diagram:** The ER diagram of your application domain, plus description.
Please make sure to specify all entity sets (and their attributes), relationship sets (with key constraints/relationship multiplicities, total participation, referential integrity constraints if applicable), primary keys, weak entities (if any). State any other assumptions you had to make for modeling the ER diagram.

Minimum Requirements: 4 entity sets, 3 relationship sets, primary key attributes being specified on all entities, relationship multiplicities being specified on all relationships (for example, many-many, many-one, one-one).

Your ER diagram must follow your specifications and assumptions. The description should clearly describe your ER diagram, in particular the entity sets, and the relationship sets in the diagram.

**Technical details**
Write 1-2 paragraphs describing (i) the language that you are going to use to implement the interface (i.e. Java, C#, Javascript, Python) (ii) DBMS that you are going to use (i.e. Mysql, Sqlite, MS SQL server..)

**Project management**
Please create a table that indicates the tentative project schedule broken down by week, what you want to accomplish for each week, and who is in charge of what each week.

**Submission should be in either pdf or Word format.**
